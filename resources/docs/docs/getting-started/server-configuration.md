The **server** can be configured with many options, either from a terminal or with the help of the **launcher**.

## Options

    - `ip_address:port`
    - `host_name:port`
    - `midi:device_name`

!!! quote ""
    #### `load`

    Path to a session file (.json). All clients connecting the server will load it.

!!! example "Example"
    ```
    open-stage-control --no-gui --load path/to/your/session.json --theme path/to/your/theme.css
    ```

    Launches the server in headless mode, and makes all clients load provided session and theme automatically.


## Running in a terminal on Windows

Windows users launching the app from a terminal need to add a double dash (`--`) and a space before their options:

```bash
open-stage-control.exe -- --port 5555 [...]

# when running from sources
npm start -- -- [options]
```
