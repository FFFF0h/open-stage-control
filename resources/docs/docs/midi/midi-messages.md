!!! info ""
    Define static argument values using the [`preArgs`](/docs/widgets/properties-reference/#preArgs) option in order to complete the respective MIDI message.

----

#### `/note channel note velocity`

NoteOn event or noteOff if velocity equals `0`. Incoming noteOff events will be received as `/note` with velocity 0 if `note_off_velocity` is not set during [setup](../midi-configuration).

- `channel`: integer between 1 and 16
- `note`: integer between 0 and 127
- `velocity`: integer between 0 and 127

!!! example "Example"

    A push button might be configured as follows in order to send a MIDI note whose velocity is defined by the button's on/off value:

    - `address`: `/note`
    - `preArgs`: `[1, 60]` (for MIDI channel 1, and note 60 / C4)
    - `on`: `100` (for noteOn velocity of 100 on button push)
    - `off`: `0` (to send a noteOff on button release)
    - `target`: `midi:device_name` (where device_name is one of the declared midi devices defined during [setup](../midi-configuration))

----

#### `/note_off channel note velocity`

NoteOff event with any velocity. Incoming noteOff events will be received as `/note_off` if `note_off_velocity` is set during [setup](../midi-configuration).

----

#### `/control channel cc value`

Control change event.

- `channel`: integer between 1 and 16
- `cc`: integer between 0 and 127
- `value`: integer between 0 and 127

!!! example "Example"

    A fader might be configured as follows in order to send a MIDI control message (a volume control in this example):

    - `address`: `/control`
    - `pre-args`: `[1, 7]` (MIDI channel 1, control number 7 generally used as volume control)
    - `range`: `{"min": 0, "max": 127}` (MIDI values are encoded in this range)
    - `target`: `midi:device_name`

----

#### `/program channel program`

Program change event.

- `channel`: integer between 1 and 16
- `program`: integer between 0 and 127*

!!! info
    \* Some devices / softwares display the `program` value between 1 and 128, thus interpreting `program change 0` as `program change 1` and so on. Add the `pc_offset` parameter to the server's `midi` option to make Open Stage Control behave this way.

----

#### `/pitch channel pitch`

PitchWheel event.

- `channel`: integer between 1 and 16
- `pitch`: integer between 0 and 16383

----

#### `/sysex msg`

System exclusive message.

- `msg`: hexadecimal sysex data string of the form `f0 ... f7`.

Instead of a single hexadecimal string, arguments can be separated and defined either as hexadecimal bytes or as integers. When received, system messages are always formatted as a single hexadecimal string.

----

#### `/mtc timecode`

MIDI time code message.

- `timecode`: `hh:mm:ss:ff` string.


----

#### `/channel_pressure channel pressure`

Channel pressure event.

- `channel`: integer between 1 and 16
- `pressure`: integer between 0 and 127

----


#### `/key_pressure channel note pressure`

Polyphonic key pressure event.

- `channel`: integer between 1 and 16
- `note`: integer between 0 and 127
- `pressure`: integer between 0 and 127
